The Team Activity Feed allows teams to have a convenient and easy-to-read feed of all recent events on their dashboard. The widget receives its events from a Team Room, so teams may configure the widget to display all and only events that matter to them.

What you can do:
* View your team's latest activity
* Filter the displayed messages by activity type
* Easily navigate to the artifacts through links in the message header
* Configure the title, size, and color theme of the widget
